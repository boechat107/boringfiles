# Boring Files

Be warned, this is a really boring repo!

This repository stores most of my dot files and some scripts to automate the
setup of a new environment.

## Usage

```bash
$ make_symlinks.sh
```

The dot files are organized with Debian in mind.

## Conventions

* Files or directories starting with `d__` are really dot files/directories. The
    path should start with `.`.
* `__` (double underscore) are path separators.

### Example

`d__config__nvim` is renamed to `.config/nvim`.
